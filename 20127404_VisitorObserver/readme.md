## What I have done: 
* Random to decide which team will go first.
* Generate randomly three chess pieces of three types Swordman, Pikeman and Knight for each team.
* Each team will take turns attacking the other's chess pieces.
* Print out the result after 3 turns.

## What I haven't done:
* Not divide the source code into multi files so it was little bit harder to check and fix bugs.
